# Introduction

Welcome to **FlexiUI** - a beautiful, fast, and modern React UI library designed to help you build exceptional user interfaces with ease.

## What is FlexiUI?

FlexiUI is a modern, open-source React UI library that provides a comprehensive set of **accessible**, **customizable**, and **production-ready** components. Built on top of Tailwind CSS and React Aria, FlexiUI combines the best of both worlds: stunning visual design with world-class accessibility.

Whether you're building a simple landing page, a complex dashboard, or a full-featured web application, FlexiUI provides all the tools you need to create beautiful, accessible, and performant user interfaces.

## Quick Start

Get up and running in minutes:

```bash
# Install FlexiUI
npm install @flexi-ui/theme @flexi-ui/system

# Install individual components
npm install @flexi-ui/button @flexi-ui/input
```

```tsx
import { Button } from '@flexi-ui/button'
import { FlexiUIProvider } from '@flexi-ui/system'

function App() {
  return (
    <FlexiUIProvider>
      <Button color="primary">Get Started</Button>
    </FlexiUIProvider>
  )
}
```

## Key Features

### 🎨 Powerful Theming System

Built on Tailwind CSS, FlexiUI offers a flexible theming system that lets you customize every aspect of your components. Define your design tokens once and apply them consistently across your entire application.

```tsx
import { flexiui } from '@flexi-ui/theme'

export default {
  plugins: [
    flexiui({
      themes: {
        light: {
          colors: {
            primary: '#0070f3',
            secondary: '#7928ca',
          },
        },
      },
    }),
  ],
}
```

### ♿ Accessibility First

Every FlexiUI component is built on **React Aria**, providing:

- **ARIA patterns** - Proper ARIA attributes and roles
- **Keyboard navigation** - Full keyboard support out of the box
- **Screen reader support** - Optimized for assistive technologies
- **Focus management** - Smart focus handling and visible focus indicators
- **WCAG compliance** - Meeting WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards

### 📘 TypeScript Native

FlexiUI is written in TypeScript from the ground up, giving you:

- **Full type safety** - Catch errors before runtime
- **IntelliSense support** - Autocomplete in your IDE
- **Type inference** - Smart prop suggestions
- **Generic components** - Type-safe polymorphic components

```tsx
import { Button } from '@flexi-ui/button'

// TypeScript knows all available props
<Button
  color="primary"      // ✓ Valid
  variant="solid"      // ✓ Valid
  size="lg"            // ✓ Valid
  invalidProp="test"   // ✗ Type error
/>
```

### ⚡ Performance Optimized

FlexiUI is designed for performance:

- **Tree-shakeable** - Import only what you need
- **Small bundle size** - Minimal overhead
- **No runtime styles** - CSS is generated at build time
- **SSR ready** - Full Server-Side Rendering support
- **React Server Components** - Compatible with RSC

### 📱 Responsive by Default

All components are built mobile-first and work seamlessly across all devices:

- **Responsive variants** - Different styles per breakpoint
- **Touch-friendly** - Optimized touch targets
- **Fluid typography** - Scales with viewport
- **Adaptive layouts** - Automatic layout adjustments

### 🧩 Modular Architecture

FlexiUI follows a modular design philosophy:

- **Independent packages** - Install only the components you need
- **Minimal dependencies** - Each package has minimal deps
- **Framework agnostic** - Works with Next.js, Remix, Vite, and more
- **Composable** - Build complex UIs from simple components

### 2. Accessibility First

Accessibility isn't an afterthought—it's fundamental:

- Every component meets WCAG 2.1 Level AA standards
- Built on battle-tested React Aria patterns
- Extensive keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader optimized

### 3. Flexibility Without Complexity

Customize everything without the complexity:

- Powerful theming system with simple API
- Override styles at any level
- Extend components easily
- No black magic - you control the output

## Architecture Overview

FlexiUI follows a layered architecture:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│   Components (@flexi-ui/button)     │  ← UI Components
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   System (@flexi-ui/system)         │  ← Component System
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Theme (@flexi-ui/theme)           │  ← Design Tokens
├─────────────────────────────────────┤
│   Tailwind CSS                      │  ← Utility Framework
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

- **Components** - Individual UI components (Button, Input, etc.)
- **System** - Core utilities and providers
- **Theme** - Design tokens and theming system
- **Tailwind CSS** - Foundation for styling
